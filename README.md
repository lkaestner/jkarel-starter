# jkarel-starter
Starter-pack for learning Java using Stanford's JKarel, including the executable and some exercises (but not their solutions).

# Disclaimer
This project uses [Stanford's JKarel](https://github.com/stepp/stanford-cpp-library/tree/master/Karel), which I did not develop.

# Usage
- You need a JDK and Eclipse
- Import the project
- Run the Java class file as Java application (do not run as Applet).
- Optional: Executing "GenerateRunConfigurations" once will conveniently create run configurations for all Karel classes.
